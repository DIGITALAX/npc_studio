I've been digging into the hardware specs and configurations needed to run these massive models, and it's not pretty.\n\nI managed to get a single RTX 4090 setup running, but even with its 24GB of VRAM, we're severely limited in the model sizes we can handle. Quantization methods like GPTQ and LLM.int8() help reduce memory footprint, but the performance hit is significant.\n\nI also explored using multiple 4090s in parallel, but scaling beyond 2 cards introduces a whole host of complications around power draw, cooling, and inter-GPU communication. The 4x 4090 setup theoretically gets us to 96GB of VRAM, but the cost and complexity is daunting.\n\nAs an alternative, I benchmarked some RTX A6000 configurations. While each card has an impressive 48GB of VRAM, the FLOPS performance is notably lower than the 4090s. So it's a tradeoff between raw compute power and memory capacity.",
